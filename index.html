                <p>
                    Messic comes from the union of two words:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Mess</strong>: A dirty or untidy state of things or of a place
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Music</strong>: Vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) combined in such a way as to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    The aim for the project is to convert this mess of music in a real ordered and cataloged music, playing it also in a confortable way. The main characteristics are:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            It order our catalog of music as automatic as possible, and it is owned only by you. You can go always to the file system where you are saving it and get it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It play the music in a very very confortable and beautiful interface.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It is executed via web, so we could publish this service at home for every device.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It is multiuser.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It's focused at home catalog music. We want to manage and listen to our own catalog of music.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Last inestable version</h3>

                <p>Our recomendation is to download only the last stable version, but if you live on the edge and need to have the last last version of messic, you can download it from github directly. By the moment, you will need to compile it, but soon we will built night builds and so on.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Which navigators are compatible?</h4>
                        Essentially all those compatible with html5 and css3, but that's not true. Please update your navigator to the last version and probably you will not have any problems.
                        <br>
                        <br>If you are trying to launch messic from a Microsoft Internet Explorer... well, good luck (really it seems that with version 11 is more or less ok). We have tested with google chrome (some versions of chromium for linux seems to have problems playing mp3 files natively), firefox, safari (from 6.1 version). Konqueror doesn't seems to be ok :(
                        <br>You can see at the <a href="https://github.com/spheras/messic/wiki/Navigator-Compatibility-Table" target="_blank">wiki pages</a> a table with the user's results launching messic in different navigators. Any help filling this table with real information is more than welcome.
                        <br>
                        <br>We are working to improve compatibility, but <strong>please, please, update your navigator always you can</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Can I share messic music through DLNA protocol with other devices?</h4>
                        Yes!, you can. You need to activate DLNA share content at the settings page of messic. There are two parts that need to be checked. The first one is the general setting to allow DLNA. This is done only by the administrator, at the administrator settings. If this is abled, then each user can allow at the music settings if they want to share their content over DLNA or not.
                        <br>
                        <br>Please, take into account that DLNA protocol doesn't have any authoring mechanisms, so, if you allow DLNA sharing content, any devices at home could get info from messic. This shouldn't be a problem if you have a controlled network, but keep in mind.
                        <br>We have tested connecting some DLNA devices to messic, but there are a lot of variety at the market. We are working constructing a table with the information given by the users. <a href="https://github.com/spheras/messic/wiki/DLNA-Compatibility-Table" target="_blank">Consult it to see if your device has been tested</a>. Any information about compatibility is more than welcome.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Does messic use a secure protocol SSL/TLS?</h4>
                        Initially no, because it's intended to be at your home, inside your home network. But if you need, you can do it by modifying the configuration.
                        <br>
                        <br>Just open the messic monitor and open the configuration section. From there you can modify a set of options, and also to enable the security (also you can specify the https protocol).
                        <br>
                        <br>After a restart of the messic service, the connections will be done through the new https port, and probably your navigator will advise you because the messic certificate doesn't correspond to the url, and so on. This is normal, but if you want also to fix it, you only need to go to the folder [messic_folder]/jetty/etc/ and you will find there all the jetty configuration. Just touch the jetty-selector-ssl.xml file with your own configuration.
                        <br>Another important question is the imposibility to share content over DLNA when the security is activated. This is really due to the problem of the certificate validation.

                    <li>
                        <h4>How can I help the project?</h4>
                        We need a lot of help. For example, translations of messic to other languages. At this time, we have not defined a protocol for external helps, but we will do. For us is very useful if you notify and describe us the bugs you find on messic. It helps a lot to improve the application. Also you can tell us your desired improvements for next versions.
                        <br>
                        <br>We really need a lot of help, like graphical designers, programmers, and so on... maybe, if you want to work seriously with us, the best way could be forking the project and pull request. You have a guide <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Can I use Messic for free?</h4>
                        Yes, its free in both senses. It has a GPLv3 license.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Where is the source code?</h4>
                        Just here: <a href="https://github.com/spheras/messic" target="_blank">https://github.com/spheras/messic</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>I want to move my music folder to other place. How can I do?</h4>
                        OK, it's very easy. All the necessary information is inside your folder (included database). So you just need to stop messic service, move the WHOLE folder (which is configured at the messic monitor). After that, open the messic monitor and update the new location in the configure section. Finally, you can launch the messic service with this new location.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>I don't see well some pages of messic. What can I do?</h4>
                        Well, in the most of cases, you should upgrade your navigator. In the case you use Internet Explorer, well... it's better to change. Give an opportunity to other navigators like <a href="https://www.mozilla.org" target="_blank">firefox</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/" target="_blank">chrome</a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Can I see messic from my mobile phone or tablet?</h4>
                        It depends. We have tested some cases and usually it works, not perfectly, but works. The best is to try and tell us your experience. We are working in this area, and also thinking to build native applications for android and ios.</a>.
